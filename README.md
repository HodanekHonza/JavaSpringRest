# Java Spring Project Documentation

## Introduction

This Java Spring project is currently in development and follows the controller pattern. We've recently implemented controller and entity (DTO) functionalities. However, it's important to note that we haven't yet incorporated interfaces, which will be part of the upcoming refactor, along with the implementation of DAO, DTO, service, and repository layers.

## Project Structure

The project is currently structured as follows:

- **src/main/java**: Contains the Java source code.
    - **com.example.project**: Root package for the project.
        - **controller**: Contains the controller classes.
        - **entity**: Contains the entity (DTO) classes.
        - (Other layers such as repository, service, etc. will be added during the refactor.)

- **src/main/resources**: Contains the application properties and other resources.

## Current State

At present, the project focuses on implementing the controller layer and defining entity (DTO) classes. The controller layer manages HTTP requests and responses, while the entity classes represent the data transferred between the client and server.

While this setup serves our immediate needs, we recognize the importance of refactoring the project to adhere to best practices and achieve a more robust architecture.

## Future Plans

In the upcoming development iterations, we plan to refactor the project to incorporate the following improvements:

1. **Interfaces**: Introducing interfaces to promote loose coupling and enhance testability.

2. **DAO, DTO, Service, and Repository Layers**: Implementing these layers to properly separate concerns and improve maintainability and scalability.

3. **Dependency Injection**: Leveraging Spring's dependency injection capabilities for more flexible and manageable code.

## Conclusion

Although the project is currently in its early stages and follows the controller pattern, it is planned to evolve into a well-structured Java Spring application with proper separation of concerns. Your contributions and feedback are valuable in achieving this goal.
